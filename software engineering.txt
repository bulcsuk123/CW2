Methodologies:
==============
For our project we mostly followed an iterative / incremental agile methodology, sometimes similar to a Scrum methodology.
The game was built in small increments, adding a new feature and then testing the feature to see if it worked and if it didn't
we fixed it and refined. The features were expanded upon in each iteration as new features were built on top of it.

This allowed us to identify problems before they became bigger issues and reduced the overall risk of larger errors. Having
all the features working properly without bugs meant that we could expand upon these without having to think about if it would
affect the rest of the project.

We chose to follow this methodology because it fit our schedule the best and allowed for good time management as we could
get on a call and worked on one feature until it worked, this mean we didn't have to come back to an unfinished implementation.

their home and their right to the throne as monarch of 'Leoporis'

Was close with the groundskeeper before the warlock took over, having a fatherly bond towards the knight who defended and taught
the protagonist the ways of the sword. After the successful escape of the heir the warlock captured the groundskeeper but through his strength thought
of a more useful. Upon finding his body controlled and contorted by the warlock in the castle grounds the protagonist
